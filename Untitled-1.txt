\n = moves the cursor to the next line
printf("hello, %s\n " , answer       );

get_string("What is your name?\n);
printf= is the go to function every time you want to print something on the screen

Joining the word "hello" that is being printed out, with the user input 
But because we dont know the user input yet, we use a placeholder using a percent sign and s 
prinf("hello, %s\n", answerr   ); separating the arguments using comma/ print out the answer + the name of the variable where the user stores its name
