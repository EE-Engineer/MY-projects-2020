- Data structures//Pointers
Arrays allow to define type variables tha can hold items of some kind.
 Similarly structure is another user defined data type variable available 
 that allows to combine data items of different kinds.

 Structures are used to represent a record.
 Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library.You might want to 
 track the following attributes about each book :
 
 -Title
 -Author
 -Subject
 -Book ID



#include "stdio."
 
 typedef structut





Pointers
Pointers are variables used to store the memmory address of other variables
int*p ;  Here, the asterisk is used to indicate that "p" is 
a pointer variable and not a normal variabe that stores values.
The content of the \c pointer always be a whole numer i.e address
Always C pointer is initalized to null, i.e int*p=null.
The value of null pointer is 0
Two pointers can be subtracted to knoe hopw many elements are available between  two these points 
But, Pointer addition, multiplication, division are not allowed.

& symbol is used to get the adress of the variable
* simbol is used to get the value of the variable that the pointer is pointing to
 example:
 #include<stdio.h>
 int main()
 {
     int*ptr, q;
     q= 50;
     //*adress pf a q os assigned to ptr//created a variable to store the value of q
     ptr = &q;
     /*displays q's value using ptr variable */
     printf("%d", ptr)
     return 0;

 }
